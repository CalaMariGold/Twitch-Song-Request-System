## Notes
The queue system is now publicly viewable with a comprehensive history section that allows users to browse past requests. The history feature includes filtering by request type and pagination for better performance. The Twitch integration will be used to provide personalized features like user-specific request history and statistics, while maintaining public access to the global queue and history.
